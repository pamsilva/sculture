# Notes

- had issues connecting to the RDS instance I created.
- had friction handling the differences between flask and fast api.

# Achievements
- basic functionality and tests

# Would do next
- try to simplify the schemas
- streamline the db management with make files to ensure schemas were present and up to date
- would do proper error handling
